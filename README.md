# DataScienceCapstone
Capstone Project for IBM Data Science Professional Certificate

Using data obtained via the Spacex API and through webscraping techniques, this project seeks to gain insight into the success of Spacex missions, particularly its introduction of the resusable first stage rocket. 
Exploratory analysis using Python libraries including Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Folium, and Dash gives an overall picture of Spacex missions, launch site locations, orbits followed, payload sizes, and whether the rocket was successfully landed for reuse.
Finally, machine learning models are trained on the data and evaluated to assess whether such models could be used to predict the success of future missions.
